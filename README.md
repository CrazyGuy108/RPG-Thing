# RPG-Thing
A prototype for an RPG made using Godot.

Something interesting to note about this game was that I didn't use any handmade sprites, only modified versions of the [Godot Engine logo](game/icon.png).

## Controls
* WASD/Arrows: Move the character.
* Space: Use the sword.

## Gameplay
You really just move around the level for now. The red enemy walks around and tries to chase you if there's a linear line of sight, but nothing happens when it finally catches you. Using the sword will kill it and that's pretty much it.

## Things I learned
* Raycasting.
* Really basic AI design.

## License
